# Must-Have Tools for Blockchain Hackathons

Welcome to this repository, which aims to provide a comprehensive list of the essential tools you will need to successfully develop projects during blockchain hackathons.

## Tool List  

- **Development Environment:** Setting up a proper development environment is crucial for hackathon success. This includes a code editor or IDE, as well as any necessary dependencies and software.  
- IDE : [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). Don't forget to install extension to help you trough your development journey.
- UNIX CMD [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads) - Very usefull if you are working on a Windows OS.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

- **Smart Contract Development:** For blockchain hackathons, it is likely that you will need to develop smart contracts. Tools such as Truffle, Ganache, and OpenZeppelin can be used to develop, test, and deploy smart contracts on various blockchain platforms.
- [Truffle](https://trufflesuite.com/) - Truffle takes care of managing your contract artifacts so you don't have to. Includes support for custom deployments, library linking and complex Ethereum applications.
```
npm install truffle -g
```
- [Truffle Contract Size](https://www.npmjs.com/package/truffle-contract-size). This Truffle plugin displays the contract size of all or a selection of your smart contracts in kilobytes.
```
npm install truffle-contract-size
```
- [Ganache](https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/) Quickly fire up a personal Ethereum blockchain which you can use to run tests, execute commands, and inspect state while controlling how the chain operates.
- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/). Crypto Wallet.

- **Blockchain Test Networks:** It is important to test your smart contracts and other blockchain-related code on a test network before deploying to the main network. Tools such as Ganache, Rinkeby, and Ropsten can be used for this purpose.  

- **Blockchain Explorers:** Blockchain explorers are useful for viewing and interacting with the blockchain. Popular choices include Etherscan and Blockchair.  

- **Communication and Collaboration:** Hackathons often involve working in teams, so it is important to have tools that enable effective communication and collaboration. Slack and Zoom are popular choices for this purpose.  

- **Project Management:** To stay organized and on track during a hackathon, it is important to use a project management tool. Trello and Asana are popular choices for this purpose.  

Note: The above list is not exhaustive and other tools may be useful depending on the specific requirements of your project. Feel free to contribute !  

## Conclusion
By having these tools in your toolbox, you will be well-equipped to handle the challenges of a blockchain hackathon and develop successful projects. Good luck and have fun!
